19yo Pythonista & Rustacean. Contact me on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#circuitsaculs-space:matrix.org).
## Tools
 - Python: The first language I learned. I've been coding in Python for nearly 7 years.
 - Rust: My favorite language to use, and what I work with the most.
 - Typescript: It's better than javascript, at least. I use it to build websites and mobile apps (with react native).
 - PostgreSQL: My go-to any time I need a database. I even wrote [an orm](https://github.com/circuitsacul/apgorm) for it.
 - Docker: I know the basics of Docker, and I'm using it in V4 of Starboard. It's nice to not have to clone & build the source code to run my apps - I just have to pull the image.
 - Git: I'm pretty good at using Git via GUIs (GitHub, GitHub Desktop, VSC, etc.), but I can use very basic features through the command line as well.
